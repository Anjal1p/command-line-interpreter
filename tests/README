To get going on the tests, simply copy the files into your current project directory.

Create a directory to store results

  mkdir results

To run all the tests, simply type:

  ./run-tests.csh

To run a specific test, type:

  ./run-tests.csh <testNumber>

as in

  ./run-tests.csh 12

Running a specific test may be useful to debug a particular problem you
are having.
